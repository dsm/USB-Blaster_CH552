# USB-Blaster Firmware for "REV. C USB BLASTER" board with CH552G chip.

This is a fork of [CH55x-USB-Blaster firmware by VladimirDuan](https://github.com/VladimirDuan/CH55x-USB-Blaster) that runs on a cheap clone Altera USB Blaster with CH552G chip.
It works correctly in Linux and Windows with my limited testing(I am testing with MAX V CPLD), no special drivers required.

#
- This fork added all needed files for correct build.
- Implement CI to build and release binary files so you don't need to setup or download any build tools or sdk files.
- support AS mode now.
